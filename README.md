# PurpleHLE
[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/not0xFF/PurpleHLE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/not0xFF/PurpleHLE)  
Open Source HLE iPhone Emulator, targeting newer iOS versions.

# What is this?
HLE emulation is higher level, so this ignores iBoot & friends and jumps straight to userland  
If you want something * proper * PLEASE check out Corellium. cmw is a true iOS emulation god, and Corellium is 
a lot better than this mess :P.
Seriously, if you want to be able to set boot args, debug a kernel, upload directly from XCode, etc, use Corellium  
If you just want games and stuff tho, this should work. (maybe)
